Polar animated chart of unemployment rates by Canadian census metropolitan areas (CMA)

Code provided to make the animated chart of Canadian unemployment rates by CMA as seen here: https://twitter.com/bcshaffer/status/975389545695858688

Data is pulled from Statistics Canada CANSIM files. 

There are 2 R files:
1) Master code to make the graph
2) Supporting code with functions to scrape and clean the data

Note: I'm still relatively new to R, so this is not by any means best practice or efficient code. It's what i like to call 'get er done' code. It does the job, but it's not pretty!
